//! The example model surface: just the [`ModelConfigExt`] factory trait (the
//! seam the generic training loop uses to stay model-agnostic) plus its impl for
//! the library's unified [`MambaLatentNetConfig`].
//!
//! The examples no longer define their own networks. They build directly from
//! the library's family-generic types (`in_proj → Layers → out_proj`, exposed as
//! the runtime-selectable [`MambaLatentNet`]); each example just picks the family
//! variant in its `model_config()`.
